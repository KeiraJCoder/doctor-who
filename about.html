    <img src="third.png" alt="Jon Pertwee">
    <p>Pertwee portrays the Third Doctor as a dapper man of action in stark contrast to his wily but less action-orientated predecessors.<br> While previous Doctors' stories had all involved time and space travel,<br> for production reasons Pertwee's stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth in exile, where he worked as a scientific advisor to the international military group UNIT. </p>

    <h2>The Fourth Doctor
        <h3>Tom Baker<br>
    <img  src="fourth.png" alt="Tom Baker">
    <p>Baker portrays the Fourth Doctor as a whimsical and sometimes brooding individual whose enormous personal warmth is at times tempered by his capacity for righteous anger. His initial companions were intrepid journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen),<br> who had travelled alongside his previous incarnation, and Surgeon-Lieutenant Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) of UNIT. His later companions were savage warrior Leela (Louise Jameson), robotic dog K9,<br> Time Lady Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), teen genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), alien teenage aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), and Australian flight attendant Tegan (Janet Fielding). </p>

    <h2>The Fifth Doctor
        <h3>Peter Davison<br>
    <img  src="fifth.png" alt="Peter Davison">

        <h3>Colin Baker<br>
    <img src="sixth.png" alt="Colin Baker">

    <h2>The Seventh Doctor
        <h3>Sylvester McCoy<br>
    <img src="seventh.png" alt="Sylvester McCoy">
    <p> McCoy portrays the Seventh Doctor as a whimsical, thoughtful character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive, and manipulative.<br> His first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer programmer who travelled with his previous incarnation, and who is soon succeeded by troubled teenager and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his protégée.</p>

    <h2>The Eighth Doctor
        <h3>Paul McGann<br>
    <img src="eigth-removebg-preview.png" alt="Paul McGann">
    <p> Paul McGann's iteration of The Doctor was introduced in the 1996 TV film Doctor Who, a back-door pilot produced in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation.<br> While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent spin-off media, including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann.<br> In 2013, the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode "The Night of the Doctor", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration into the War Doctor (played by John Hurt).</p>

    <h2>The Ninth Doctor
        <h3>Christopher Eccleston <br>
    <img src="ninth.png" alt="Christopher Eccleston">
    <p> Eccleston's Doctor was a war-torn loner who disguises his trauma brought on by the Time War using a sense of humour and determination to protect the innocent.<br> The production team's approach to the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston portraying the character as being less eccentric.</p>

    <h2 id="fave">The Tenth Doctor<br>
        <h3>David Tennant<br>
    <img src="tenth.png" alt="David Tennant">
    <p>  Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked.<br><br>
    Unlike his predecessor, Christopher Eccleston, who confessed to having only a passing interest in the 1963 version of Doctor Who.</p>

    <h2>The Eleventh Doctor
    <h3>Matt Smith<br>
    <img src="eleventh.png" alt="Matt Smith">

        <h3>Peter Capaldi<br>
    <img  src="twlethj.png" alt="Peter Capaldi">
